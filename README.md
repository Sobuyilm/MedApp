# MedApp
Idea: You open the app and you scan the prescription. The app shows how many times a day you need to take the medicine (for example, 3 times a day = every 8 hours). The app resembles a signal at a certain time.

Add (+): choose the picture of the prescription from the gallery or scan the prescription

My medications: you see what day is it today, how many pills have you already taken, time and name of the medication.

Health condition: you can choose from mood, pain and sleep. Mood: good, bad, so so. Pain: you can write what kind of pain do you have. Sleep: how much and how good have you slept today.
